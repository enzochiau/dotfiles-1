====

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Install

Run this:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tcnksm/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

This script will install Homebrew packages and Emacs Casks. And every dotfiles are linked to `$HOME` directory.
